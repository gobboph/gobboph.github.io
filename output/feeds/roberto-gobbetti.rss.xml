And how do they change from state to state? I did and I tried to answer with &lt;a href="http://gobboph.github.io/election_words/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; little project of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked who are the folks tha get re-elected a lot in congress and what they talk about. To do that I used again some resources from the &lt;a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/"&gt;Sunlight Foundation&lt;/a&gt; together with some wikipedia entry (I had to pin down all the people that have passed through congress in the past 20 years somehow).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis is totally preliminary and can be improved a lot, but it already shows something. First of all it is clear that one has to talk about their own regional problems (cities and boroughs are popular choices). Hovering around the map some topic of federal interest show up: obamacare, fracking, clean energy, iraq. On the other hand it is also clear that certain topics are regional: gambling in the south, HIV in big cities, fishing in the very North East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly though, can anybody explain to me the deal between South Carolina and Bulgaria?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Roberto Gobbetti</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2014 12:50:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:localhost:8000,2014-08-04:blog/election_words/</guid><category>programming</category><category>social</category></item><item><title>Congress Words in Sunlight Foundation Blog</title><link>http://localhost:8000/blog/congress_words_3/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Congress Words only works thanks to the &lt;a href="sunlightfoundation.com"&gt;Sunlinght Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which provides the API's through their wonderful project &lt;a href="capitolwords.org"&gt;capitolwords.org&lt;/a&gt;. A while ago someone at the Sunlight Foundation saw my project and decided it was interesting enough to mention it in their official blog, so &lt;a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/05/29/use-sunlights-apis-for-your-own-project/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the entry where they talk about me and Congress Words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is extremely flattering that my little project caught their attention and made it to their blog! I think the foundation is doing an amazing job and I hope I will be able to contribute more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Roberto Gobbetti</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2014 12:45:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:localhost:8000,2014-06-21:blog/congress_words_3/</guid><category>programming</category><category>social</category></item><item><title>Congress Words Update</title><link>http://localhost:8000/blog/conrgess_words_update/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago I decided to learn some JavaScript. I have been toying for a while with the idea of extending my little congress_words project to a website, so what better occasion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rewrote the project so it runs entirely on JavaScript, using only jQuery and &lt;a href="http://gobboph.github.io/congress_words/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script is not too complicated, but it works well and, most importantly, I learned a lot while doing it; now I feel way more confident in my beaing able to learn something quickly. You can find the code at the github page of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/gobboph/congress_words/tree/gh-pages"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; (in the master branch you can still see the python script).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play with &lt;a href="http://gobboph.github.io/congress_words/"&gt;it&lt;/a&gt; and let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Roberto Gobbetti</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2014 20:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:localhost:8000,2014-04-26:blog/conrgess_words_update/</guid><category>programming</category><category>social</category></item><item><title>Unwinding Inflation gets attention</title><link>http://localhost:8000/blog/unwinding_inflation/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The data release of &lt;a href="http://bicepkeck.org/"&gt;BICEP2&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago caused much excitement in the physics community and justly so. First of all we were able to detect gravitational waves for the first time, albeit not directly. These gravitational waves were produced in a very early stage of our universe, as predicted by the inflationary paradigm, which in turn gets an important observational confirmation. Although we need confirmation from other experiments, the amount of gravitational waves that has been detected is much more than many people expected, thus ruling out the vast majority of models of inflation based on a microscopic theory of the very high energy (see String Theory).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is: Unwinding Inflation still stands! The model I developed together with my collaborators is one of the very few that might be able to explain inflation using String Theory. Lots of work still needs to be done on Unwinding to show that it can be embedded naturally into String Theory, but the road seem promising. This is very exciting for us and we are very much looking forward to future developements.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Roberto Gobbetti</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2014 10:35:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:localhost:8000,2014-04-14:blog/unwinding_inflation/</guid><category>science</category></item><item><title>Congress Words</title><link>http://localhost:8000/blog/conrgess_words/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I spent a night last week having fun while working out this new project on github: &lt;a href="https://github.com/gobboph/congress_words"&gt;congress_words&lt;/a&gt;. Using the API's of &lt;a href="capitolwords.org"&gt;capitolwords.org&lt;/a&gt;, the scripts outputs a map of the US colored accordingly to how many times a given word or sentence of your choice has been pronunced by a representative of each state, of course normalized by number of state representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this to be a fantastic tool for procrastination and I plan to develop it into a website soon (it is important to be able to procrastinate no matter where we are). So come back to it soon!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Roberto Gobbetti</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2014 10:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:localhost:8000,2014-04-14:blog/conrgess_words/</guid><category>programming</category><category>social</category></item><item><title>First blog post</title><link>http://localhost:8000/blog/first-post/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;My personal website goes online! I have been toying with the idea of sitting down and building one for way too long, but finally here it is. This website is built with &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/"&gt;pelican&lt;/a&gt; and is online through my &lt;a href="https://github.com/gobboph"&gt;github page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will use the blog to write about science, technology, politics, or really whatever I get interested into. Feel free to contact me.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Roberto Gobbetti</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2014 18:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:localhost:8000,2014-03-27:blog/first-post/</guid><category>miscellanea</category></item></channel></rss>
