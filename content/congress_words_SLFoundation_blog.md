Summary: congress_words mentioned in Sunlight Foundation blog

Congress Words only works thanks to the [Sunlinght Foundation](sunlightfoundation.com), which provides the API's through their wonderful project [capitolwords.org](capitolwords.org). A while ago someone at the Sunlight Foundation saw my project and decided it was interesting enough to mention it in their official blog, so [here](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/05/29/use-sunlights-apis-for-your-own-project/) is the entry where they talk about me and Congress Words.

It is extremely flattering that my little project caught their attention and made it to their blog! I think the foundation is doing an amazing job and I hope I will be able to contribute more in the future.
