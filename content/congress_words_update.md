Summary: Update about congress_words project

A couple of days ago I decided to learn some JavaScript. I have been toying for a while with the idea of extending my little congress_words project to a website, so what better occasion?

I rewrote the project so it runs entirely on JavaScript, using only jQuery and [here](http://gobboph.github.io/congress_words/) is the result.

The script is not too complicated, but it works well and, most importantly, I learned a lot while doing it; now I feel way more confident in my beaing able to learn something quickly. You can find the code at the github page of the [project](https://github.com/gobboph/congress_words/tree/gh-pages) (in the master branch you can still see the python script).

Play with [it](http://gobboph.github.io/congress_words/) and let me know what you think.
