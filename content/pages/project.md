Here is a (not so complete) list of projects/idea/stuff not physics related, that I have worked on or I am working on right now:

* [election_words](http://gobboph.github.io/election_words/):  Following up on congress_words (check just down here), I asked myself: what should one be talking about to be elected to congress? And how does that change state by state? To answer that I found out what the people that get re-elected a lot talk about and [here](http://gobboph.github.io/election_words/) is my (preliminary) analysis. You can find the project [on github](https://github.com/gobboph/election_words) and let me know what you think of it.

* [congress_words (website)](http://gobboph.github.io/congress_words/): I extended the congress_words project above and rewrote it to make it a website ([here](http://gobboph.github.io/congress_words/)). I used only JavaScript and jQuery, there is no python script in the backend. Play with it! (And check it out [on github](https://github.com/gobboph/congress_words/tree/gh-pages)).

* [congress_words](https://github.com/gobboph/congress_words): This python script outputs a map of the US in which each state is colored based on how many times a congress member from that state has pronunced the word or expression of your choice. To play around with the maps visit [this website](http://gobboph.github.io/congress_words/), where I implemented it online (see down under the map for details). Here is an example: a map genareted using the word 'welfare':

<center><img src="../images/welfare.png" alt="welfare map" style="width: 400px;"/></center>
<!--![alt text](../images/welfare.png "welfare map" )-->
<!--{% img img-thumbnail float-left /images/welfare.png 450 %}-->

* [floodmyhood](http://gobboph.github.io/floodmyhood/): This ongoing collaborative project is aimed to show the effects of ice melting and its actual impact.

* [Portfolio Tracker](http://gobboph.github.io/Portfolio_Tracker/): This is a python tool that allows you to manage a stock portfolio. Just run the code and you will be able to buy the stocks that you want, see they value and the value of your portfolio.
