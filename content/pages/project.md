These are some projects I am pursuing outside of physics

* [Portfolio Tracker](http://gobboph.github.io/Portfolio_Tracker/): This is a python tool that allows you to manage a stock portfolio. Just run the code and you will be able to buy the stocks that you want, see they value and the value of your portfolio.
* [floodmyhood](http://gobboph.github.io/floodmyhood/): This ongoing collaborative project is aimed to show the effects of ice melting and its actual impact.
* [congress_words](https://github.com/gobboph/congress_words): This python script outputs a map of the US in which each state is colored based on how many times a congress member from that state has pronunced the word or expression of your choice. To play around with the maps visit [this website](http://gobboph.github.io/congress_words/), where I implemented it online (see down under the map for details). Here is an example: a map genareted using the word 'welfare':

<center><img src="../images/welfare.png" alt="welfare map" style="width: 400px;"/></center>
<!--![alt text](../images/welfare.png "welfare map" )-->
<!--{% img img-thumbnail float-left /images/welfare.png 450 %}-->

* [congress_words (website)](https://github.com/gobboph/congress_words/tree/gh-pages): I extended the congress_words project above and rewrote it to make it a website ([here](http://gobboph.github.io/congress_words/)). I used only JavaScript and jQuery, there is no python script in the backend. Play with it!
