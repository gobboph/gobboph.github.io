These are some projects I am pursuing outside of physics

* [Portfolio Tracker](http://gobboph.github.io/Portfolio_Tracker/): Python tool I wrote to manage stocks portfolio.
* [floodmyhood](http://gobboph.github.io/floodmyhood/): Ongoing collaborative project aimed to show the effects of ice melting and its actual impact.
* [congress_words](https://github.com/gobboph/congress_words): I wrote this script that outputs a map of the US in which each state is colored based on how many times a congress member from that state has pronunced the word or expression of your choice.
