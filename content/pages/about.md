I am a Ph.D. candidate in Theoretical Physics at the [Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics](http://ccpp.nyu.edu/), at [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu). I work both on Cosmology and String Theory, trying to explain the first using the second. I was born in Milan, Italy, and before moving to New York City I studied Physics between [Pavia University](http://www.unipv.eu/site/en/home.html) and [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/).

In more details, my research focuses on designing a way our universe could have been born and look the way it does. Even if we do have a good amount information about the very first moments of our universe, still making sense of it all in a nice form is an open challenge.

You can find a list of my papers down in this page, or [here](http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&p=find+a+gobbetti&of=hb&action_search=Search). Here is my full [CV in pdf]({filename}/files/CV.pdf). Feel free to contact me at <roberto.gobbetti@nyu.edu>.
