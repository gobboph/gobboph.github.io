Summary: congress_words.

I spent a night last week having fun while working out this new project on github: [congress_words](https://github.com/gobboph/congress_words). Using the API's of [capitolwords.org](capitolwords.org), the scripts outputs a map of the US colored accordingly to how many times a given word or sentence of your choice has been pronunced by a representative of each state, of course normalized by number of state representatives.

I find this to be a fantastic tool for procrastination and I plan to develop it into a website soon (it is important to be able to procrastinate no matter where we are). So come back to it soon!
