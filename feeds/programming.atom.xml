A while ago someone at the Sunlight Foundation saw my project and decided it was interesting enough to mention it in their official blog, so &lt;a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/05/29/use-sunlights-apis-for-your-own-project/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the entry where they talk about me and Congress Words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is extremely flattering that my little project caught their attention and made it to their blog! I think the foundation is doing an amazing job and I hope I will be able to contribute more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="programming"></category><category term="social"></category></entry><entry><title>Congress Words Update</title><link href="/blog/conrgess_words_update/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-04-26T20:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Roberto Gobbetti</name></author><id>tag:,2014-04-26:blog/conrgess_words_update/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago I decided to learn some JavaScript. I have been toying for a while with the idea of extending my little congress_words project to a website, so what better occasion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rewrote the project so it runs entirely on JavaScript, using only jQuery and &lt;a href="http://gobboph.github.io/congress_words/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script is not too complicated, but it works well and, most importantly, I learned a lot while doing it; now I feel way more confident in my beaing able to learn something quickly. You can find the code at the github page of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/gobboph/congress_words/tree/gh-pages"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; (in the master branch you can still see the python script).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play with &lt;a href="http://gobboph.github.io/congress_words/"&gt;it&lt;/a&gt; and let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="programming"></category><category term="social"></category></entry><entry><title>Congress Words</title><link href="/blog/conrgess_words/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-04-14T10:30:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Roberto Gobbetti</name></author><id>tag:,2014-04-14:blog/conrgess_words/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent a night last week having fun while working out this new project on github: &lt;a href="https://github.com/gobboph/congress_words"&gt;congress_words&lt;/a&gt;. Using the API's of &lt;a href="capitolwords.org"&gt;capitolwords.org&lt;/a&gt;, the scripts outputs a map of the US colored accordingly to how many times a given word or sentence of your choice has been pronunced by a representative of each state, of course normalized by number of state representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this to be a fantastic tool for procrastination and I plan to develop it into a website soon (it is important to be able to procrastinate no matter where we are). So come back to it soon!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="programming"></category><category term="social"></category></entry></feed>
