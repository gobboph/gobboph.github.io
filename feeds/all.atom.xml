I have been toying for a while with the idea of extending my little congress_words project to a website, so what better occasion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rewrote the project so it runs entirely on JavaScript, using only jQuery and &lt;a href="http://gobboph.github.io/congress_words/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script is not too complicated, but it works well and, most importantly, I learned a lot while doing it; now I feel way more confident in my beaing able to learn something quickly. You can find the code at the github page of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/gobboph/congress_words/tree/gh-pages"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; (in the master branch you can still see the python script).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play with &lt;a href="http://gobboph.github.io/congress_words/"&gt;it&lt;/a&gt; and let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="programming"></category><category term="social"></category></entry><entry><title>Unwinding Inflation gets attention</title><link href="/blog/unwinding_inflation/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-04-14T10:35:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Roberto Gobbetti</name></author><id>tag:,2014-04-14:blog/unwinding_inflation/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The data release of &lt;a href="http://bicepkeck.org/"&gt;BICEP2&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago caused much excitement in the physics community and justly so. First of all we were able to detect gravitational waves for the first time, albeit not directly. These gravitational waves were produced in a very early stage of our universe, as predicted by the inflationary paradigm, which in turn gets an important observational confirmation. Although we need confirmation from other experiments, the amount of gravitational waves that has been detected is much more than many people expected, thus ruling out the vast majority of models of inflation based on a microscopic theory of the very high energy (see String Theory).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is: Unwinding Inflation still stands! The model I developed together with my collaborators is one of the very few that might be able to explain inflation using String Theory. Lots of work still needs to be done on Unwinding to show that it can be embedded naturally into String Theory, but the road seem promising. This is very exciting for us and we are very much looking forward to future developements.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="science"></category></entry><entry><title>Congress Words</title><link href="/blog/conrgess_words/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-04-14T10:30:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Roberto Gobbetti</name></author><id>tag:,2014-04-14:blog/conrgess_words/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent a night last week having fun while working out this new project on github: &lt;a href="https://github.com/gobboph/congress_words"&gt;congress_words&lt;/a&gt;. Using the API's of &lt;a href="capitolwords.org"&gt;capitolwords.org&lt;/a&gt;, the scripts outputs a map of the US colored accordingly to how many times a given word or sentence of your choice has been pronunced by a representative of each state, of course normalized by number of state representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this to be a fantastic tool for procrastination and I plan to develop it into a website soon (it is important to be able to procrastinate no matter where we are). So come back to it soon!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="programming"></category><category term="social"></category></entry><entry><title>First blog post</title><link href="/blog/first-post/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-03-27T18:30:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Roberto Gobbetti</name></author><id>tag:,2014-03-27:blog/first-post/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My personal website goes online! I have been toying with the idea of sitting down and building one for way too long, but finally here it is. This website is built with &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/"&gt;pelican&lt;/a&gt; and is online through my &lt;a href="https://github.com/gobboph"&gt;github page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will use the blog to write about science, technology, politics, or really whatever I get interested into. Feel free to contact me.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="miscellanea"></category></entry></feed>
